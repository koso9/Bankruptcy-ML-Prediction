# AI-Driven Credit Risk Assessment for Banking: Predicting Bankruptcy with Machine Learning

## Overview
Bankruptcy prediction is a critical tool for financial institutions, investors, and risk managers. This project leverages machine learning models to assess corporate financial health, reducing risk exposure and enhancing portfolio decision-making. Using the **Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset (2000–2013)**, this model evaluates key financial indicators to classify firms as financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy. This project achieved **96.28% accuracy using Calibrated XGBoost**, demonstrating a scalable approach to modern credit risk evaluation and financial health assessment.

## Key Features
**Machine Learning Models**:
This project evaluates multiple models to balance accuracy, precision, and recall for bankruptcy prediction:

- **Baseline Model: Logistic Regression**:
  - A straightforward, explainable starting point leveraging essential financial metrics.
  - **Accuracy**: 94.91%
  - **Precision (Minority Class)**: 50.00%
  - **Recall (Minority Class)**: 0.009%
  - **F1-Score (Minority Class)**: 0.018
    
- **Advanced Model: Random Forest**:
  - Achieves **95.14% accuracy**, uncovering complex relationships in financial data.
  - **Precision (Minority Class)**: 95.24%
  - **Recall (Minority Class)**: 4.54%
  - **F1-Score (Minority Class)**: 8.66%

- **Advanced Model: XGBoost Model**:
  - Achieves **95.84% accuracy**, brief sentence.
  - **Precision (Minority Class)**: 90.00%
  - **Recall (Minority Class)**: 20.41%
  - **F1-Score (Minority Class)**: 33.27%
    
- **Advanced Model: Calibrated XGBoost (Best Model)**:
  - Achieves **96.01% accuracy**, brief sentence.
  - **Precision (Minority Class)**: 80.65%
  - **Recall (Minority Class)**: 28.34%
  - **F1-Score (Minority Class)**: 41.95%
    
**Why Calibrated XGBoost?**  
By applying Isotonic Regression, the calibrated XGBoost model improves probability estimates, making it more effective for financial decision-making where precision and recall must be balanced.
